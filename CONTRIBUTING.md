### Project Structure

Pegasus is organized as a pnpm workspace monorepo:

```
pegasus/
├── apps/
│   ├── ui/              # React + Vite + Electron frontend
│   └── server/          # Express + WebSocket backend
├── libs/
│   ├── @pegasus/types/            # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── @pegasus/utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── @pegasus/prompts/          # AI prompt templates
│   ├── @pegasus/platform/         # Platform abstractions
│   ├── @pegasus/model-resolver/   # AI model resolution
│   ├── @pegasus/dependency-resolver/ # Dependency management
│   └── @pegasus/git-utils/        # Git operations
├── docs/                # Documentation
└── package.json         # Root package configuration
```

**Key conventions:**

- Always import from `@pegasus/*` shared packages, never use relative paths to `libs/`
- Frontend code lives in `apps/ui/`
- Backend code lives in `apps/server/`
- Shared logic should be in the appropriate `libs/` package

---

## Pull Request Process

This section covers everything you need to know about contributing changes through pull requests, from creating your branch to getting your code merged.

### Branching Strategy

All development targets the `main` branch directly.

**Before creating a PR:**

1. **Sync with upstream** - Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. **Base your work on `main`** - Create your feature branch from the latest `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout upstream/main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Target `main` in your PR** - When opening your pull request, set the base branch to `main`

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# 2. Create your branch from main
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode upstream/main

# 3. Make your changes and commit
git commit -m "feat: Add dark mode support"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/add-dark-mode

# 5. Open PR targeting main
```

### Branch Naming Convention

We use a consistent branch naming pattern to keep our repository organized:

```
<type>/<description>
```

**Branch types:**

| Type       | Purpose                  | Example                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `feature`  | New functionality        | `feature/add-user-authentication` |
| `fix`      | Bug fixes                | `fix/resolve-memory-leak`         |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes    | `docs/update-contributing-guide`  |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring       | `refactor/simplify-api-handlers`  |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests | `test/add-utils-unit-tests`       |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks        | `chore/update-dependencies`       |

**Guidelines:**

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens (no underscores or spaces)
- Keep descriptions short but descriptive
- Include issue number when applicable: `feature/123-add-login`

```bash
# Create and checkout a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode

# Create a fix branch with issue reference
git checkout -b fix/456-resolve-login-error
```

### Commit Message Format

We follow the **Conventional Commits** style for clear, readable commit history:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

**Commit types:**

| Type       | Purpose                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                 |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                     |
| `docs`     | Documentation only          |
| `style`    | Formatting (no code change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring          |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests    |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks           |

**Guidelines:**

- Use **imperative mood** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under **72 characters**
- Capitalize the first letter after the type prefix
- No period at the end of the subject line
- Add a blank line before the body for detailed explanations

**Examples:**

```bash
# Simple commit
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication flow"

# Commit with body for more context
git commit -m "fix: Resolve memory leak in WebSocket handler

The connection cleanup was not being called when clients
disconnected unexpectedly. Added proper cleanup in the
error handler to prevent memory accumulation."

# Documentation update
git commit -m "docs: Update API documentation"

# Refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: Simplify state management logic"
```

## Code Style Guidelines

Pegasus uses automated tooling to enforce code style. Run `pnpm format` to format code and `pnpm lint` to check for issues. Pre-commit hooks automatically format staged files before committing.

---

## Testing Requirements

Testing helps prevent regressions. Pegasus uses **Playwright** for end-to-end testing and **Vitest** for unit tests.

### Running Tests

Use these commands to run tests locally:

| Command                     | Description                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm test`                 | Run E2E tests (Playwright)            |
| `pnpm test:server`          | Run server unit tests (Vitest)        |
| `pnpm test:packages`        | Run shared package tests              |
| `pnpm test:all`             | Run all tests                         |
| `pnpm test:server:coverage` | Run server tests with coverage report |

**Before submitting a PR**, always run the full test suite:

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

### Test Frameworks

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests verify the entire application works correctly from a user's perspective.

- **Framework:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- **Location:** `e2e/` directory
- **Test ports:** UI on port 3007, Server on port 3008

**Running E2E tests:**

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test

# Run with headed browser (useful for debugging)
pnpm exec playwright test --headed

# Run a specific test file
pnpm --filter @pegasus/ui test -- tests/example.spec.ts
```

**E2E Test Guidelines:**

- Write tests from a user's perspective
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use appropriate timeouts for async operations
- Prefer `locator` over direct selectors for resilience

#### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Unit tests verify individual functions and modules work correctly in isolation.

- **Framework:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Location:** In the `tests/` directory within each package (e.g., `apps/server/tests/`)

**Running unit tests:**

```bash
# Run all server unit tests
pnpm test:server

# Run with coverage report
pnpm test:server:coverage

# Run package tests
pnpm test:packages

# Run in watch mode during development
pnpm exec vitest --watch
```

**Unit Test Guidelines:**

- Keep tests small and focused on one behavior
- Use descriptive test names: `it('should return null when user is not found')`
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit under test
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just line coverage

### Writing Tests

#### When to Write Tests

- **New features:** All new features should include tests
- **Bug fixes:** Add a test that reproduces the bug before fixing
- **Refactoring:** Ensure existing tests pass after refactoring
- **Public APIs:** All public APIs must have test coverage

### CI/CD Pipeline

Pegasus uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration. Every pull request triggers automated checks.

#### CI Checks

The following checks must pass before your PR can be merged:

| Check             | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Format**        | Verifies code is formatted with Prettier    |
| **Build**         | Ensures the project compiles without errors |
| **Package Tests** | Runs tests for shared `@pegasus/*` packages |
| **Server Tests**  | Runs server unit tests with coverage        |

#### CI Testing Environment

For CI environments, Pegasus supports a mock agent mode:

```bash
# Enable mock agent mode for CI testing
PEGASUS_MOCK_AGENT=true pnpm test
```

This allows tests to run without requiring a real Claude API connection.

#### Viewing CI Results

1. Go to your PR on GitHub
2. Scroll to the "Checks" section at the bottom
3. Click on any failed check to see detailed logs
4. Fix issues locally and push updates

#### Common CI Failures

| Issue               | Solution                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Format check failed | Run `pnpm format` locally                  |
| Build failed        | Run `pnpm build` and fix TypeScript errors |
| Tests failed        | Run `pnpm test:all` locally to reproduce   |
| Coverage decreased  | Add tests for new code paths               |

### Coverage Requirements

While we don't enforce strict coverage percentages, we expect:

- **New features:** Should include comprehensive tests
- **Bug fixes:** Should include a regression test
- **Critical paths:** Must have test coverage (authentication, data persistence, etc.)

To view coverage reports locally:

```bash
pnpm test:server:coverage
```

This generates an HTML report you can open in your browser to see which lines are covered.

  - Operating System and version
  - Node.js version (`node --version`)
  - Pegasus version or commit hash
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Numbered list of steps to reproduce the bug
- **Expected Behavior:** What you expected to happen
- **Actual Behavior:** What actually happened
- **Logs/Screenshots:** Any relevant error messages, console output, or screenshots

**Example Bug Report:**

```markdown
## Bug: WebSocket connection drops after 5 minutes of inactivity

### Environment

- OS: Windows 11
- Node.js: 22.11.0
- Pegasus: commit abc1234

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start the application with `pnpm dev:web`
2. Open the Kanban board
3. Leave the browser tab open for 5+ minutes without interaction
4. Try to move a card

### Expected Behavior

The card should move to the new column.

### Actual Behavior

The UI shows "Connection lost" and the card doesn't move.

### Logs

[WebSocket] Connection closed: 1006
```

### Feature Requests

We welcome ideas for improving Pegasus! Here's how to submit a feature request:

#### Before Requesting

1. **Check existing issues** - Your idea may already be proposed or in development
2. **Consider scope** - Think about whether the feature fits Pegasus's mission as an autonomous AI development studio

#### Feature Request Template

A good feature request includes:

- **Title:** A brief, descriptive title
- **Problem Statement:** What problem does this feature solve?
- **Proposed Solution:** How do you envision this working?
- **Alternatives Considered:** What other approaches did you consider?
- **Additional Context:** Mockups, examples, or references that help explain your idea

**Example Feature Request:**

```markdown
## Feature: Dark Mode Support

### Problem Statement

Working late at night, the bright UI causes eye strain and doesn't match
my system's dark theme preference.

### Proposed Solution

Add a theme toggle in the settings panel that allows switching between
light and dark modes. Ideally, it should also detect system preference.

### Alternatives Considered

- Browser extension to force dark mode (doesn't work well with custom styling)
- Custom CSS override (breaks with updates)

### Additional Context

Similar to how VS Code handles themes - a dropdown in settings with
immediate preview.
```

### Security Issues

**Important:** If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead:

1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jjem7aEDKU) and send a direct message to the user `@webdevcody`
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce
3. Allow time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.
