/**
 * Integration tests for pipeline summary accumulation across multiple steps.
 *
 * These tests verify the end-to-end behavior where:
 * 1. Each pipeline step produces a summary via agent-executor → callbacks.saveFeatureSummary()
 * 2. FeatureStateManager.saveFeatureSummary() accumulates summaries with step headers
 * 3. The emitted auto_mode_summary event contains the full accumulated summary
 * 4. The UI can use feature.summary (accumulated) instead of extractSummary() (last-only)
