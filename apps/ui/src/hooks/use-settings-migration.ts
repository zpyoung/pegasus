/**
 * Settings Migration Hook and Sync Functions
 *
 * Handles migrating user settings from localStorage to persistent file-based storage
 * on app startup. Also provides utility functions for syncing individual setting
 * categories to the server.
 *
 * Migration flow:
 * 1. useSettingsMigration() hook fetches settings from the server API
 * 2. Checks if `localStorageMigrated` flag is true - if so, skips migration
 * 3. If migration needed: merges localStorage data with server data, preferring more complete data
 * 4. Sets `localStorageMigrated: true` in server settings to prevent re-migration
 * 5. Hydrates the Zustand store with the merged/fetched settings
 * 6. Returns a promise that resolves when hydration is complete
 *
 * IMPORTANT: localStorage values are intentionally NOT deleted after migration.
 * This allows users to switch back to older versions of Pegasus if needed.
 *
 * Sync functions for incremental updates:
 * - syncSettingsToServer: Writes global settings to file
 * - syncCredentialsToServer: Writes API keys to file
 * - syncProjectSettingsToServer: Writes project-specific overrides
