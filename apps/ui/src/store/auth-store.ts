 * skipping the spinner entirely. The background verify in __root.tsx will correct
 * this if the session is invalid.
 *
 * This runs synchronously at module load time — before createRoot().render() —
 * so the first React render never shows the !authChecked spinner for returning users.
 *
 * We only set settingsLoaded=true when setupComplete is also true in the cache.
 * If setupComplete is false, settingsLoaded stays false so the routing effect in
 * __root.tsx doesn't immediately redirect to /setup before the setup store is hydrated.
 * In practice, returning users who completed setup have both flags in their cache.
 *
 * Intentionally minimal: only checks for the key existence and basic structure.
 * Full hydration (project data, settings) is handled by __root.tsx after mount.
